  about:
    intro: |
      Psy-High is an arts and culture experience based around the interplay of music, seminars, theatre, debates, readings and workshops.
      We also give a lot of attention to changing the location as much as possible in accordance with the main themes and concepts of the festival.  Psy-High 2015 will increase in length to four full days – two days just weren't enough to enjoy the event for most people.

      The basics of why and how we make Psy-High happen stay the same: We do everything we can by our own hands, without profit and without sponsors - except for the growing number of people ready to fuel the event with their personal energy.

      We'll continue the string of amazing locations: Last year's “rocky cathedral” of the Saint Joseph quarry is followed by a wide, flooded quarry somewhere in the western parts of Czech Republic.
      We're still keeping the location a secret for now, but get ready for 13,000 m² of five-pointed lake surrounded by 7.5 hectars of awesomeness).
      You will receive the exact location in an e-mail sent month before the festival.
      For purposes of planning, we will tell you this: the location lays in a 50 km radius from the city of Pilsen.
