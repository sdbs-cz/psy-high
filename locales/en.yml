      We chose the st. Joseph quarry primarily for it’s ‘earthiness’ - the way the rocks chime with the forest and how nature slowly erased almost all signs of past human activity. It’s a place filled with a solid, calm ambiance where you can almost feel the deep rumble of ancient underground rocky massives interweave with the sounds and smells of trees. The quarry was active since the second half of the 19th century, it’s finest sandstone was being used primarily for sculptures, for example the ones at the roof of the National Theater in Prague.
