# A mystical way of doing this and that...

<div class="txt-col">
Our festival is a ritual that combines all the people, ideas, places and arts into a breathing entity surpassing the limitations of flesh and perception. Everything is done with our own hands, without profit on our minds and without any sponsors other than the increasing number of people who give Psy-High their energy. Sigils have been cast, glyphs engraved, seals put in place, wards built. Our thoughts and our actions make this happen and we want you to experience it with us. For us, Psy-High is "the art of supporting art", all steps in the organization and the whole community being tweaked and transmuted again and again in order to make it all run as smooth as possible, because the journey is the experience itself. The boundaries between organizer and performer and guest are blurred &mdash; and we like it that way.

# A dose of partnership culture and the drug of *making things happen*...

<div class="txt-col">
Psy-High is a manifestation of the Partnership Culture concept, as opposed to the Dominator Culture. We want everybody to experience what an event like this can taste like and to take their memories and feelings back home, as seeds of an ever-expanding Indra's net of understanding, creativity, vitality and love. When your talents and capabilities are pooled together with others in mutual respect and cooperation, something just switches in your mind. That's Psy-High, the substance of what this is all about - a place where artful expressions of joy, awe, melancholy, rage, inspiration and all others are seen as important parts of the human being in all its complexity and capacity. That's why we're doing this.

# Growth and the Method...

<div class="txt-col">
Ours is a small gathering, modest and focused. Fortunately, there are sure ways of finding the right people and the right paths. Today, there are dozens of individuals seeing Psy-High as a way to realize their idea of what an event like this can become. We have managed to get in touch with seasoned veterans of event management as well as inspired young talent, designers, builders, speakers, administrators... The Method is simple: "If you like what we're doing so much that you're willing to do it, even though it's so hard and so weird, you're in." At any time, with any idea - just let us know.

# The look and feel of the place...
  
<div class="txt-col">
Each of our events (Psy-High is not our only festival, it's just the most positive and celebration-focused one) is defined and refined by the participation of many artists and builders, who work at the chosen location tirelessly for days before the festival itself can happen. Their goal is to change the surroundings, make them more conducive of the high ideals and to shape the location into a piece of reality fine-tuned for something like this to take place there. Then, the bands and the visitors arrive and the whole festival explodes into life. The seminars and debates, workshops and readings then happen wildly all around the programme-backbone formed by the bands.
